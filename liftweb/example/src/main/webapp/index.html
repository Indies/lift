		<h2>Welcome to the <i>lift</i> Web Framework</h2>
		<p><i>lift</i> is yet another web development framework.
		<i>lift</i> runs inside a Java web container and
		uses the <a href='http://scala-lang.org'>Scala</a> programming language for coding.
<i>lift</i> stresses security, developer productivity, ease of deployment, ease of maintainability, performance, and compatibility with existing systems.</p>
<p><i>lift</i> borrows from the best of existing frameworks including 

<a href='http://seaside.st/'>Seaside's</a> highly granular sessions and security,
<a href='http://www.rubyonrails.com/'>Rails</a> fast flash-to-bang, 
<a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django's</a> "more than just CRUD is included",
and <a href='http://erlyweb.org/'>Erlyweb's</a> scalability for Comet-style applications.</p>

<p><i>lift</i> is built on <a href='http://scala-lang.org'>Scala</a>, a hybrid Functional and 
O-O language that compiles code down to the Java Virtual Machine.
Scala code can call any Java code and make use of all Java classes.
Java code can call some Scala code. <i>lift</i> applications are packaged as WAR files and 
can be deployed on any
Servlet 2.4 engine (e.g., Tomcat 5.5.xx, Jetty 6.0, etc.)</p>

<p><i>lift</i> code is as clean and brief as Rails, yet performs 6 times faster and
is multithreaded.  Additionally, because Scala is strongly typed, the compiler
catches type errors.  For example:<br/>
<code>
<pre>
User.find(ByField(User.email, "foo@bar.com")) // legal
User.find(ByField(User.id, 20)) // legal
User.find(ByField(User.id, "foo@bar.com")) // compiler error
</pre>
</code>
But the LoC and total character count for <i>lift</i> and Rails substantive code is similar,
however, the LoC for <i>lift</i> tests is about 60% compared to Rails because there's no need
to write tests for type-related issues.
</p>

<p><i>lift</i> is currently in 'early alpha' state.  Use at your own risk.
Things might break.  APIs might change.  You know the drill.</p>
<p><i>lift</i> is an open source project distributed under an Apache License V2.0</p>
