      <action dev="David Pollak" type="update">
Further abstracted the whole logging thing.

There's a default log4j setup that can be override

The LiftLogger trait is made concrete in Log4JLogger, but the
generic LiftLogger creation is done by function that can
be modified in LogBoot:
  var loggerByName: String => LiftLogger = _logger
  var loggerByClass: Class => LiftLogger = _loggerCls

One can insert a new logging system into lift by replacing
the loggerByName and loggerByClass functions with appropriate
functions that return a LiftLogger.
