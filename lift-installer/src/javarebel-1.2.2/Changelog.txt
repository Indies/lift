1.1-M3 (9th April 2008)

* JavaRebel now supports reloading changes made to classes in JAR files, for that you need to specify "JavaRebel-Reloadable: true" in MANIFEST.MF or name the JAR file ending with a "-reloadable.jar" suffix.
* Improved logging, now all information on where the class is loading from goes to plaintext log ("-Drebel.log=true").

 * Annotation reloading. Annotations on classes, methods and fields will be updated when the class is reloaded. At the moment this does not include annotations on constructors and method parameters.

1.0  (5th December 2007)

 * Eclipse PDE support. Plugin code can now be reloaded using JavaRebel. See this post and screencast for details. Instructions are in the installation manual.
 * IntelliJ IDEA plugin development support. Plugin code can now be reloaded using JavaRebel. Instructions are in the installation manual.
 * Java EE container support. We now support Orion and Caucho Resin under Java 5. Instructions are in the installation manual.
 * Custom classloader support. If JavaRebel doesn't officially support your container or you use a custom classloader there is a good chance it will work now. 
 * All known issues fixed.

1.0 M3 (5th November 2007)

 * No more need for "-Xbootclasspath/a:javarebel.jar" if the name of the JAR is not changed. JavaRebel will detect if the name of JAR is changed and suggest to either rename it or add to boot classpath.
 * Major improvements in performance. Startup time should in many cases improve two or more times (if slower than vanilla JVM). JavaRebel should also no longer use CPU when the application is idle.
 * Improved support for anonymous classes. Since compiler names anonymous classes consequently, adding a new one may rename all the rest and change their super classes and interfaces. Now JavaRebel handles such renaming without problems. This feature is disabled by default since some problems have been tracked to it. To enable add "-Drebel.enable_anon=true" to the command line.
 * Update notification. JavaRebel will now notify you when a newer version is available. No personal information (not even the currently installed version) is going ot ZeroTurnaround. To disable the feature add "-Drebel.disable_update=true" to the command line.

 * Fixed problems with circular class dependency 
 * Minor fixes
